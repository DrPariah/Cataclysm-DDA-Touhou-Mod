# Cataclysm-DDA-Touhou-Mod
Goes in data/mods.

Contains new professions based off of Touhou, a special scenario with the Touhou professions and less limits on where to start, and new clothing/weapons/profession traits/etc specifically made for certain professions.

Other mods required would be Necromancy (Wicked Hermit spawns with a Dormant Minion), Arcana Mod (Wicked Hermit knows Arcana skill), and More Classes and Scenarios (Starting locations from both of them are used).

Playing as a male survivor will only change the underwear (Boxers instead of panties) and nothing else (still wearing a dress/skirt/etc) at the moment. There is no compatibility with Chesthole or tilesets that actually display clothing and gear at the moment.
