# Cataclysm-DDA-Touhou-Mod
Goes in data/mods.

Contains new professions based off of Touhou, a special scenario with the Touhou professions and less limits on where to start, and new clothing/weapons/profession traits/etc specifically made for certain professions. Development is semi-active and mostly on a "when I feel like it" basis. The mod is considered unfinished, but functional.

Other mods required would be Arcana Mod (Wicked Hermit knows Arcana skill), and More Classes and Scenarios (Starting locations from both of them are used).

Playing as a male survivor will only change the underwear (Boxers instead of panties) and nothing else (still wearing a dress/skirt/etc) at the moment. There is no compatibility with Chesthole or tilesets that actually display clothing and gear at the moment.

----------------------------------------------------------------
**New Professions:**

* **Phantom Swordswoman:** Close-range killing machine. Knows Niten Ichi-Ryu, and has a katana and wakizashi (can't dual-wield unfortunately). Anything that gets in range of her will die in a flurry of sword slashes, but anything with a gun will utterly ruin her day unless she learns how to use one.
* **Wicked Hermit:** Zombie Zlave master. Has the skills necessary to revive zombie corpses as loyal zlaves, knowledge of magic, and the ability to pass through walls via the Probability Travel CBM. Can easily build up an army of zombie zlaves. Befitting her lack of empathy, selfishness, and disrespect for the dead, she starts with the Psychopath trait. Starts with no weapons at the moment.
* **Lunatic Moon Rabbit:** Gunslinger. Proficient in the usage of all firearms and has a targeting Bionic to enhance her accuracy even further. Packs a unique, UPS-powered pistol that can fire in bursts with a custom holster, has a Unified Power System CBM, and has the ability to shoot hostiles with her fingers alone.
* **Celestial Delinquent:** Made of iron. Resistant to pain and is tough enough to have natural armor. Carries a Sword of Hisou that takes up no space in her inventory until it is summoned into battle.
* **Chief Maid of the SDM:** Time-stopping, knife-throwing maid. Has several throwing knives, and a Time Dilation CBM.
* **Moon Rabbit Recruit:** Lunar Defense Corps Trainee and royal pet of the Watatsukis. Not quite as proficent in the usage of firearms compared to the Lunatic Moon Rabbit. Has a teleportation CBM, a downgraded ability to shoot hostiles with her fingers, and a special Lunar Rifle with a shoulder strap and bayonet.
* **Oarfish Messenger:**
* **Hourai Incarnate:**
* **Lateral-Thinking Kappa:** WIP.

**New Weapons:**
* **Sword of Hisou:**
* **Lunatic Pistol:**
* **Lunar Rifle:**
