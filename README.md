# Cataclysm-DDA-Touhou-Mod
Goes in data/mods.

Contains new professions based off of Touhou, a special scenario with the Touhou professions and less limits on where to start, and new clothing/weapons/profession traits/etc specifically made for certain professions.

Other mods required would be Necromancy (Wicked Hermit spawns with a Dormant Minion), Arcana Mod, and More Classes and Scenarios (Starting locations from both of them are used). I tend to play with pretty much all of the mainline mods.
